  Project Nexus - Online Poll System Backend


  
  ## Overview
  This repository contains the development of an Online Poll System Backend as part of the ProDev Backend Engineering Project Nexus. The project showcases advanced backend skills using Django, PostgreSQL, and Swagger for a real-time voting system.

  ## Project Description
  - **Objective**: Build a RESTful API for creating polls, casting votes, and computing real-time results.
  - **Features**: Poll creation with options and metadata, vote submission with duplication prevention, and efficient result computation.
  - **Technologies**: Python, Django, Django REST Framework, PostgreSQL, Swagger.

  ## Development Plan
  - Database Design: ERD using Draw.io for polls, votes, and options.
  - Implementation: Django ORM and REST endpoints.
  - Deployment: Hosted on PythonAnywhere.
  - Documentation: Swagger UI at `/api/docs`.

  ## Next Steps
  - Complete ERD and ORM implementation.
  - Develop API endpoints for poll management, voting, and results.
  - Test and deploy.
